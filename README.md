# 11 Mohamed's Note Taking!

## Your Task

Hello, welcome to my note taker app. It was quite difficult but I managed to overcome the odds.


## What it shows

This is exactly what it looks like when you run the app.

![Note titled “Balance accounts” reads, “Balance account books by end of day Monday,” with other notes listed on the left.](./Assets/11-express-homework-demo-02.png)


## Difficulties

What made it difficult was to use the heroku app and just backend in general.
